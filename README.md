# Pixel-image-appearing

# FOR RUNNING:
Run the file main.py

# PURPOSE:
It first will ask you for the absolute path of an image that shouldn't have too many different colors in it.
Otherwise it will slow the program, keep in mind that the maximum number of loops is the name of its colors (that were
ofc restrained); being shown in the terminal.
PS: It accelerates overtime.
